## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project is built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies:

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content and creating the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling the web pages, ensuring a modern and responsive design. This includes custom CSS and potentially frameworks.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements, dynamic content, and client-side logic.
  - Files like `scripts.js`, `general-member.js`, and `Authentication/auth.js` are key.
- **PHP**: Used for server-side scripting, particularly for fetching dynamic content like events and notices from a backend.
  - Examples: `get_events.php`, `get_notices.php`.
- **Firebase**: Utilized for backend services such as authentication, database, and hosting.
- **NPM**: Package manager for front-end libraries, indicated by `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- **Git**: For version control and collaborative development.
